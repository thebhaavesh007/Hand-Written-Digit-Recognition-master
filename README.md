# Handwritten Digit Classification

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify handwritten digits (0-9). The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, a widely-used benchmark dataset for image classification tasks.

## Overview

- **Objective**: Develop a model to accurately classify handwritten digits.
- **Dataset**: MNIST dataset (28x28 pixel grayscale images of digits).
- **Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn.
- **Model Type**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the MNIST dataset.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- **`src/`**: Source code for the handwritten digit classification model.
  - `train.py`: Script for training the model.
  - `predict.py`: Script for making predictions on new images.
- **`models/`**: Saved model weights and architecture.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of the handwritten digit classification model on our [website](https://your-demo-url.com). You can interact with the model, upload your own handwritten digits, and see the predictions in real-time.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Train the model:

bash
python src/train.py
Make predictions:

bash
python src/predict.py --image_path path/to/image.png
Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated on a test set, and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are reported. The evaluation results can be found in the notebooks/evaluation.ipynb notebook.

## Deployment
For deployment, consider using a web application framework (e.g., Flask or Django) to create an interface for users to interact with the trained model. The model can be deployed on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
